# AMPL mod file for k-means with continuous centroids

# Sets
set observations; # index for observations
set centroids; # index for centroids

# Data
param observations_x {i in observations}; # x-coordinates of observations and cluster 1
param observations_y {i in observations}; # y-coordinates of observations and cluster 1

# Variables
var z {i in observations, j in centroids} binary; # assignment of observations to centroids
var t_x {i in observations, j in centroids}; # auxiliary variable for x-distances of observations to centroids
var t_y {i in observations, j in centroids}; # auxiliary variable for y-distances of observations to centroids
var p {i in observations, j in centroids}; # auxiliary variable for the objective function
var centroids_x {j in centroids}; # x-coordinates of centroids
var centroids_y {j in centroids}; # y-coordinates of centroids


# Objective
minimize cost: sum {i in observations, j in centroids} p[i, j];
